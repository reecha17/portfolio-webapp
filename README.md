# Personal Website - MERN Stack Portfolio Project

## Overview

This project is a personal website built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). It serves as a showcase of my web development skills and demonstrates my ability to create dynamic, full-stack applications. Through this project, I learned the fundamentals of web development, including API integration, CRUD functionality, and database management.

## Features

### 1. **Random User Table**
- Integrated the [Random User Generator API](https://randomuser.me/) to populate a table with random user information.
- Displayed user details such as:
  - Profile picture
  - Name
  - Phone number
  - City
- Learned how to fetch and display data dynamically using React and REST APIs.

### 2. **Mock Order Page**
- Created a mock order page where users can simulate placing an order.
- Designed a user-friendly interface to demonstrate form handling and state management in React.

### 3. **Valorant Match Statistics Logger**
- Built a page to manually log Valorant match statistics.
- Implemented full CRUD functionality:
  - **Create**: Add new match statistics.
  - **Read**: View logged match data in a table.
  - **Update**: Edit existing match entries.
  - **Delete**: Remove match entries.
- Connected the application to a MongoDB database for persistent data storage.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **API Integration**: Random User Generator API
- **Styling**: CSS and Bootstrap

## Lessons Learned

- **MERN Stack Fundamentals**: Gained hands-on experience with MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.
- **API Integration**: Learned how to fetch and display data from external APIs.
- **CRUD Operations**: Implemented full CRUD functionality with MongoDB.
- **State Management**: Improved understanding of React state and props.
- **Database Design**: Designed and managed a MongoDB database for storing user data and match statistics.

## Future Improvements

- Add authentication and user accounts for personalized experiences.
- Enhance the UI/UX with more advanced styling frameworks like Material-UI.
- Deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku, or Vercel).
- Integrate additional APIs for more dynamic features.
